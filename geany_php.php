Usually the agricultural produce is purchased from the farmers at a low price and sold to the consumers at relatively 
very high price because of a large number of middlemen involved.
small farmers in the area being cheated by middlemen. Some farming families had been unable to 
repay loans over three generations and few or I would say a lot even committed suicide. 







 
Direct contact between the farmer and retail seller or wholesaler can reduce the number of middlemen 
involved in the marketing chain. A mobile based App that can facilitate the direct contact between producer 
(farmer) and buyer may reduce this wide price gap or a real time 
interactive system for communication between farmers and Mandis. 
Agriculture in Rajasthan is full of challenges due to many geographical issues but still 
our farmer's do their best with their skillset.
